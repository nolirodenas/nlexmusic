What I changed:

- Added `src/services/index.js` and moved the API functions there.
- Kept `src/api.js` as a re-export shim so existing imports won't break.
- Added `src/components/index.js` barrel to centralize component exports.
- Added `src/hooks/index.js` barrel to centralize hook exports.

Suggested next cleanup steps (manual or I can do them):

- Replace imports like `import X from '../components/X'` with `import { X } from '../components'` where desired.
- Move large assets in `public/uploads` into a dedicated `media/` folder if you want.
- Consider grouping `pages/` into `views/` if you prefer that naming.
- Remove unused PHP files that are no longer referenced by the React app.

If you want, I can now automatically update a set of imports to use the new barrels, or perform deeper re-organization (move files between folders, rename folders) â€” tell me how aggressive to be.
